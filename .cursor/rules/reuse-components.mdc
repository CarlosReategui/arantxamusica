# Code Reusability

- **Refactor when possible**: If you see repeated code patterns, extract them into reusable components or utilities.
- **Reuse existing components**: Before creating new components, check if similar functionality already exists in `app/components/`.
- **Follow DRY principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Consolidate duplicate logic.
- **Check styleguide components**: Components in `app/components/styleguide/` are designed to be reusable across the project.
